# concinnity
clean and aesthetic CLI counter tool!
    > harmony or elegance of design in adaptation of parts to a whole or to each other

## features
- easy to use theme management and configuration!
- runs on any machine
- support for up to 20 counters consecutively! increment or decrement with your keyboard
- adaptive based on your terminal size and shape!
- press `=` (the plus key) to create a new counter instantly
- press the `[` key then any increment or decrement key to edit the name or any counter (i recommend you use short names)
- press `]` to change the color in the same way! from a theme, or custom
- use `'` to manually input the value of any counter
- `-` will delete a counter
- this app will save automatically when you modify any counter!

## installation
`pip install concinnity`, or if you're on certain flavors of linux (it'll tell you) `pipx install concinnity`. please don't install from github!
arch: `sudo pacman -S python-pipx` to get that tool

## usage
you can run the command `concinnity`, but i will admit it's a pain to memorize - feel free to type `counter` instead :)

certain amounts of my code from [hackaclime](https://github.com/qwikster/hackaCLIme/) was reused in this project; however, no AI was used.
