- use `'` to manually input the value of any counter

## installation
`pip install concinnity`, or if you're on certain flavors of linux (it'll tell you) `pipx install concinnity`.\
please don't install from github!\
arch: `sudo pacman -S python-pipx` to get that tool

## usage
you can run the command `concinnity`, but i will admit it's a pain to memorize...\
feel free to type `counter` instead :)
